# AdventOfCode2021

The files in the src directory are my JavaScript solutions to the puzzles posed each day.
Each one of them is designed to execute directly in the browser developer console with the
input data file loaded as the main page.

Feel free to crib from these and use them as a learning exercise, and I'm happy to talk about
them to anyone interested in a fuller explanation - just message me.

I make no warranties about the quality of the code - it's all going to be pretty rough and ready...
